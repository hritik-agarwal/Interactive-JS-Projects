The project is to create a drumkit i.e. on opening the webpage the keyboard buttons on the home row are shown & on pressing those keys on the keyboard, a particular drum beat or sound is played.

Some Features:
* On Repeatedly pressing the same key, the tone start from start & perfectly match the timing.
* The key pressed is highlighted on the page to show which key is pressed.
* If wrong Key is pressed it is simply ignored.
